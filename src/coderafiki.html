                        Coderafiki initiative is a an afterschool program designed to 
                        teach school going children at the primary and highschool level 
                        how to code. The projects focuses on traning the students on key aspects
                        used when coding such as problem solving, creativity , team work and
                        attention to detail.At the advanced levels students get learn advanced concepts such as
                        <ul>
                            <li>Web3 development</li>
                            <li>Blockchain development</li>
                            <li>Airtifical Intelligence</li>

                    <p>
                        Our main objective is to impart basic knowledge of how 
                        to code and use coding as a tool for problem solving 
                        in the community.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Our objectives</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To create a trend of curiosity for computer programming and careers available in the IT space</li>
                        <li>To collaborate with schools in order to form after school coding clubs.</li>
                        <li>To offer quality guidance and mentorship to students interested in learning how to code</li>
                        <li>To identify challenges faced by students when accessing IT information and materials for practice</li>
                        <li>To determine the impact of early introduction to coding for students</li>

                    Kenya and Africa are still  significantly behind when it come to 
                    awareness about the importance of IT and most importantly coding. 
                    A very small population in the continent is equipped with knowledge 
                    of how day to day and emerging technology such as web3 and mobile devices 
                    applications, blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality work .
                    Studies have shown that early exposure to coding can help increase problem 
                    solving tendencies and the curious approach to difficult problems in the society. 
                    Children exposed to coding at an early stage tend to develop an early interest in 
                    coding not only will they learn the art of making and creating programs from 
                    scratch but they can also develop nextgen projects which could solve real-world 
                    issues. Life skills such as critical thinking and decision making are also known 
                    to improve with exposure to coding.
